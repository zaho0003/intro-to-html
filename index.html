       <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
          Hey, my name is Anees. I am a first-year Graphic Design student at Algonquin College in Ottawa.
          I like to play soccer and I like seeing Leo Messi play. I enjoy creating designs that are not only visually
          appealing but also meaningful and functional for the audience. My background in creative problem-solving
          has helped me alot and I want to master this skill.
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition to my studies, I am motivated by continuous learning and self-improvement. I enjoy exploring
          new design tools, learning from feedback, and challenging myself to grow both creatively and professionally.
          I believe that discipline, consistency, and passion are key factors in achieving long-term success, 
          and I aim to apply these values to both my academic and personal goals.
        </p>
